## Week-2 challenge (Takeaway)
This is the weekend challenge of my week 2 in Makers academy. I acts as an application allowing users to place orders from a restaurant's menu for delivery, and if their order is successful, they shall receive a text message on their mobile confirming when they'll receive their meal(s).

## Motivation
To confirm to myself before anyone else that I've improved over that past two weeks and that I'm comfortable putting all new skills learnt to practice.

## Tech/framework used

<b>Built with</b>
- Ruby
- RSpec
- Twilio API

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project theyâ€™ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.

## Credits
Give proper credits. This could be a link to any repo which inspired you to build this project, any blogposts or links to people who contrbuted in this project.
